# Signal Types Reference

Catalog of signal categories to scan for during prospect analysis. Each signal type includes what to look for, what situation it implies, and how it maps to campaign approaches.

This catalog is ICP-agnostic by design — it lists every generic signal category a B2B outbound system might use. Not every category applies to every ICP. Before scoring, load `context/icp.md`'s **Growth Signal**, **Company Size**, and **Industry** fields and use them to decide which categories below are in scope and how their strength thresholds should be read for the current ICP. Do not hardcode a specific ICP's numbers or assumptions into this file — if `context/icp.md` changes, this file's guidance should still apply without editing it.

## 1. Tech Stack Signals

### Direct competitor usage
**What to look for:** Prospect uses a product that directly competes with your offering. Sources: BuiltWith, website footer, integrations page, G2/Capterra reviews, job posts mentioning specific tools.
**What it implies:** They've already bought into the problem space. They know the pain exists. The question is whether their current tool is solving it well enough.
**Sub-signals:**
- Negative reviews of the competitor (switching intent)
- Multiple tools duct-taped together to do what your offer does in one (fragmentation pain)
- Competitor is known to be sunsetting or raising prices
- Job posts asking for experience with the competitor tool (deepening investment — harder to switch, but validates the pain)

**Signal strength:** 8-10 if switching signals present; 5-7 if just using the competitor with no friction signals.
**Best approach:** Pain-led — "I noticed you're using [competitor]. Most teams I talk to who run [competitor] end up [specific pain]. Is that your experience?"

### Adjacent tool usage
**What to look for:** Prospect uses tools in the same ecosystem but not a direct competitor. They're solving related problems, which means the core problem likely exists.
**What it implies:** They have the problem but haven't found or prioritized a dedicated solution. They may be patching it with workarounds.
**Signal strength:** 5-7
**Best approach:** Pain-led — reference the adjacent tools as context for why the core problem persists.

### No tooling / manual processes
**What to look for:** No evidence of any tool in the category. Job posts mention manual processes. Website describes workflows that should be automated but aren't.
**What it implies:** Either the pain isn't acute enough yet, or the team doesn't know solutions exist, or they're too resource-constrained to implement one.
**Signal strength:** 4-6 (depends on where the company sits within `context/icp.md`'s Company Size band — a company near the top of the range with no tooling = higher intent than one near the bottom)
**Best approach:** Value-led — "I mapped out how [similar company] automated [process]. Thought it might be relevant since you seem to be handling this manually."

## 2. Hiring Signals

### Role that your product replaces or augments
**What to look for:** Job post for a role whose core responsibilities overlap with what your product does. Sources: LinkedIn jobs, TheirStack, Indeed, company careers page.
**What it implies:** They're feeling the pain enough to throw headcount at it. If your offer can solve the problem for less than a salary, the ROI case writes itself.
**Signal strength:** 8-10 (especially if multiple similar roles posted)
**Best approach:** Pain-led — "I saw you're hiring a [role]. Most companies hiring for this are spending 40% of that person's time on [task the product automates]. Worth a look?"

### Hiring in adjacent function
**What to look for:** Hiring in the department or function that your product serves, but not the exact role.
**What it implies:** The team is growing, which means the underlying operational pain is about to get worse. More people = more coordination = more need for tooling.
**Signal strength:** 5-7
**Best approach:** Pain-led — reference the growth and the operational challenge it creates.

### Leadership hire in relevant function
**What to look for:** New VP/Director/Head of [relevant function] hire.
**What it implies:** New leaders audit and fix systems in their first 90 days. They're looking for quick wins and willing to evaluate new tools.
**Signal strength:** 7-9
**Best approach:** Pain-led — "New [title] hires usually audit [area] in their first quarter. One thing that usually comes up is [pain]. Seeing that?"

## 3. Growth Signals

Which of these sub-types are relevant depends entirely on `context/icp.md`'s Growth Signal field — read it before applying any of these. For an ICP defined around headcount growth or expansion (not outside financing events), skip "Recent fundraise" and weight "Expansion signals" and hiring-driven growth instead.

### Recent fundraise
**What to look for:** Applicable only if `context/icp.md`'s Growth Signal field names financing events (e.g., funding rounds, PE/VC investment) as relevant to this ICP. Sources: Crunchbase, press releases, LinkedIn announcements.
**What it implies:** Fresh capital + pressure to hit milestones = willingness to buy tools that accelerate growth. Especially relevant if the announcement mentions the area your product serves.
**Signal strength:** 6-8 (higher if the use-of-funds aligns with your offer's area)
**Best approach:** Pain-led — reference the growth challenge that comes with scaling.
**Skip this sub-type entirely** if `context/icp.md` describes an ICP of traditionally financed operating companies rather than externally funded ones — do not score or reference a financing event that doesn't fit the ICP's actual profile.

### Expansion signals
**What to look for:** Opening new offices, entering new markets, launching new products. Sources: press releases, LinkedIn, job posts in new locations.
**What it implies:** Expansion creates operational strain. Processes that worked at one location/market break when replicated.
**Signal strength:** 6-7
**Best approach:** Pain-led or Value-led — reference the specific expansion and the operational challenge it creates.

## 4. Operational / Review Signals

### Negative reviews (of their product/service)
**What to look for:** G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, app store reviews that mention issues your product could address (slow onboarding, bad integrations, manual processes, poor support).
**What it implies:** Their customers are feeling pain that traces back to an operational gap your offer can fill.
**Signal strength:** 7-9 (if reviews specifically mention the problem area)
**Best approach:** Value-led — "I was reading your G2 reviews and noticed [X pattern]. Most companies I work with solve this by [approach]. Want me to show you how?"

### Pricing / business model signals
**What to look for:** Pricing page reveals their market positioning, margins, and who they serve. Fee structures that create friction for their customers.
**What it implies:** Understanding their business model helps tailor the pitch to their economics.
**Signal strength:** 4-6 (contextual, not standalone)
**Best approach:** Use as context within another signal's campaign.

### Public complaints or operational gaps
**What to look for:** Social media posts, forum threads, Reddit, or support pages indicating operational problems. Sources: Twitter/X, Reddit, community forums, support docs.
**What it implies:** The pain is real enough that people are talking about it publicly.
**Signal strength:** 7-9
**Best approach:** Pain-led — reference the specific complaint pattern.

## 5. Content / Awareness Signals

### Blog posts about the problem
**What to look for:** Prospect's blog discusses challenges in the area your product serves. They're writing about the pain, researching solutions, or sharing their approach.
**What it implies:** They're problem-aware. They know the challenge exists. They may be evaluating solutions or building internally.
**Signal strength:** 6-8 (higher if the content is recent and indicates active evaluation)
**Best approach:** Value-led — reference their content and add a specific insight they didn't cover.

### Conference attendance / speaking
**What to look for:** Team members attending or speaking at conferences related to your space. Sources: event websites, LinkedIn posts, Apify scrapers.
**What it implies:** They're investing time in the problem space. Conference attendees are often evaluating vendors or looking for best practices.
**Signal strength:** 5-7
**Best approach:** Pain-led — reference the conference and the specific topic as a hook.

### Job description language
**What to look for:** Job descriptions that describe the problem your offer solves — even if the role itself isn't a direct match. Language like "manage multiple tools," "streamline processes," "reduce manual work."
**What it implies:** The pain is embedded in how they describe their own operations.
**Signal strength:** 6-8
**Best approach:** Pain-led — quote the JD language back to them.

## 6. Platform / Marketplace Signals (Vertical-specific)

Examples of how vertical context shapes which signals to scan for. Extend per vertical.

### For fitness / events / community platforms
- **Ticketing platform used:** Eventbrite, Universe, Splash — each implies different pain points around fees, customization, community features
- **Instagram following + engagement:** Indicates community strength and whether they have audience but lack monetization tools
- **ClassPass / Mindbody presence:** Indicates booking/scheduling stack and potential dissatisfaction with fees or limitations
- **GMV / event volume:** Proxy for business maturity and whether they're ready for better tooling
- **Scattered tech stack:** Shopify + Calendly + Stripe + Mailchimp = fragmented operations that a unified platform solves

### For manufacturing / supply chain
- **Job posts for supply chain coordinators:** Indicates manual coordination pain
- **ERP/SCM tools mentioned:** SAP, Oracle, NetSuite — indicates enterprise maturity but potential gaps in communication/exception handling
- **Conference attendance (MD&M, CSCMP):** Indicates active investment in supply chain improvement
- **Multiple communication channels:** Email + WhatsApp + phone for supplier comms = classic procurement/supplier management pain
- **Supplier base size and complexity:** More suppliers = more exceptions = more need for monitoring/automation

## Signal Combination Patterns

The most powerful targeting comes from combining signals:

| Combination | Strength | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Hiring + Competitor usage | 9-10 | Hiring a role AND using a competitor with bad reviews |
| Growth signal + No tooling | 8-9 | Fresh growth event (per `context/icp.md`'s Growth Signal field — funding, expansion, or headcount) + no solution in place = budget + urgency |
| Hiring + Blog content | 7-9 | Hiring for the role + writing about the problem = active evaluation |
| Competitor + Negative reviews | 8-10 | Using competitor + their own customers complaining = switching intent |
| Growth + Manual processes | 7-8 | Expanding + still doing things manually = breaking point |

When multiple signals are found, lead with the highest-intent combination rather than listing signals individually.
